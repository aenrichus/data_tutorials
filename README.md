Tutorials on using R for playing with data

## Dealing with data in dplyr
This tutorial goes through some of the functions available in dplyr for cleaning data. The data consists of the output from Eprime of a lexical decision task. Worked through it and thirsting for more? Need a quick reference tool going forward? The folks at R Studio have a very helpful [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) that you should print and post on the wall next to your desk. Trust me.

## Getting good at ggplot2
